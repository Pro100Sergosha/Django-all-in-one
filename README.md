# Django All in One

This project combines 30 Django project ideas from [UpGrand](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/django-project-ideas-topics-beginners/) into a single repository.

The goal is to practice a wide range of Django features — authentication, CRUD, APIs, WebSockets, file handling, PDF generation, and more — by implementing 30 mini-projects as individual Django apps under one project.

Each app will focus on a specific functionality or use case, from to-do lists and chat apps to e-commerce, resume builders, translators, and weather apps.

This is a personal learning project and is not intended for production use.
